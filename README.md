## TITLE 

  Element-to-calcium (X/Ca) ratios, measured in marine organisms such as foraminifera, coral, and mollusks, are frequently used as geochemical proxies for paleoclimate reconstructions. Whereas X/Ca ratios in abiotic calcium carbonate reflect the abundance of those elements in ambient seawater (as well as water temperature), X/Ca ratios in biominerals are often distinct from the surrounding seawater. These so-called “vital effects” describe the biological control that calcifying organisms exhibit over their internal environment during the calcification process (Blamart et al., 2007; Cohen and Gaetani, 2011). While vital effects can elucidate interesting properties of the biomineralization process, they often obstruct the use of X/Ca ratios as paleoclimate proxies. Some studies have attempted to circumvent this issue by quantifying species-specific calibrations between X/Ca ratios and the environmental variable in question, however this can only be accomplished if the species in question is extant  (Trotter et al., 2011). The fact that these calibrations are species-specific implies that phylogeny impacts X/Ca ratios and, by extension, suggests that the trace elements incorporated into biominerals can be correlated with an organism’s taxonomy and evolutionary history (Edgar et al., 2017). The present study aims to examine a suite of X/Ca ratios in extant cnidaria in order to test the hypothesis that X/Ca ratios in biomineralizers are linked to an organism’s evolutionary history.
